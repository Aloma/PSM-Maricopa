# PSM-Maricopa
This project explains how the matching of kids under treatment was done to kids under non-treatment on the basis of their features, 
so as to understand the effect of treatment on the kids and how it is making a difference. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is the statistical technique 
used where the propensity score is assigned for a kid based on the cumulative values of his chracteristics.

The MatchIt package in R was used to apply the PSM.

The results of the project were used to conduct interviews of the matched treated kids so as to realise if the treatment was effective.
